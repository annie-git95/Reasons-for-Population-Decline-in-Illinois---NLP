       "      <td>Chicago's teachers union voted to approve a tentative contract agreement with city officials Wednesday but refused to end a strike that has canceled two weeks of classes unless the city's mayor adds school days to cover that lost time.\\nMayor Lori Lightfoot said Wednesday night that she would not meet that demand. Lightfoot accused the union's top leadership of \"moving the goal posts\" by raising the issue Wednesday rather than in a face-to-face meeting with her on Tuesday.\\n\"Not once during that three-and-a-half-hour meeting did they raise compensation for strike days,\" Lightfoot said heatedly. \"Not once.\"\\nLightfoot refused from the start of the strike to lengthen the school year to make up days. Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson said it would require cutting winter or spring break days or adding days to the end of the year.\\nUnion president Jesse Sharkey said the teachers are not asking to be paid for a strike but do credit the walkout for forcing the district to compromise on some contract issues.\\n\"Over the past two weeks we have obtained gains that are meaningful for students that will make schools better for years to come,\" he said. \"The commitment for nurses, social workers and resources to help homeless students are things that wouldn't have been accomplished if we hadn't walked the picket lines.\"\\nSharkey said teachers consider a refusal to make up school days \"punitive\" and argued that it would ultimately hurt students, including those who must take standardized tests and college admission tests this year.\\n\"We feel like we're just being punished because we had the audacity to defy the mayor,\" Sharkey said. \"And that's not right.\"\\nThe agreement that the 700 members of the union's House of Delegates approved on Wednesday were not immediately released but Sharkey said some of teacher's wins could \"transform\" schools in the district.\\nBroad outlines include a 16% raise for teachers during the five-year contract, a new committee to investigate and enforce classroom sizes that surpass limits in the agreement and funding to add social workers and nurses to the city's neediest schools.\\n\"We've met them on every single issue,\" Lightfoot said. \"The fact that our children are not back in school tomorrow is on them.\"\\nUnion leadership said the tentative agreement does not include additional preparation time for elementary school teachers, which was a sticking point during talks this week.\\nThe strike, which has lasted nearly two weeks, has kept more than 300,000 students out of school. Following the union's decision, CPS canceled classes for the 11th day.\\nEarlier Wednesday, several high school football teams that are at risk of being locked out of the state playoffs if the walkout endures got a temporary reprieve Wednesday.\\nThe Illinois State High School Association said in a news release that the school district agreed to let the teams practice during the strike. They would not be able to play in games on Saturday if the strike hasn't been settled by then.\\nThe announcement came just in time for 19 schools whose teams qualified for the state playoffs because IHSA rules require teams from schools where teachers are on strike to practice for three days before they play a game.\\nThe teams can only practice if they find coaches that have the proper certification or meet various requirements. The district did not immediately respond to a request for comment on how many of the schools had found coaches.\\nCopyright 2019 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The only thing you cannot replace is you and your family.\" by Versha Sharma Published on 10/28/2019 at 11:00PM\\nAssociated Press Relentless Wildfires Rage Across California With No Sign Of Stopping There are now two major raging wildfires threatening both Northern and Southern California, prompting Gov. Gavin Newsom to declare a state of emergency. The Getty Fire, which started overnight in Los Angeles, joins the Kincade Fire that started in Sonoma County last Wednesday. Last night, the Kincade Fire was still burning out of control in its fifth day, dropping from 10% containment to 5% due to hurricane-force winds and dry conditions that have allowed it to spread and made it difficult to control. Several smaller fires are also burning throughout the state, and “ extremely critical fire weather conditions ” will remain.\\nAt around 2 a.m. Monday, a fire erupted near LA’s famed Getty Museum. Police told thousands of people to evacuate, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, LeBron James, and LA Mayor Eric Garcetti’s parents. About 25,000 live in the LA evacuation zone, which covers a swath of high-priced real estate. A fire in December 2017 lit up the same area and forced drivers into a horrifying, apocalyptic-looking morning commute .\\nHere’s the latest:\\nOfficials are still investigating the source of both fires, though Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) has told state regulators one of its power lines malfunctioned, which may have started the Kincade Fire. PG&amp;E is also being criticized for how it handled preemptively cutting off power to 1.3 million California residents. The utility company did it to avoid the possibility of more downed power lines, but many customers complained that they weren’t given enough notice and that the lack of power — which has now lasted for days — is incredibly disruptive, especially to low-income and elderly communities . There have been 200,000 evacuations in Sonoma County because of the Kincade Fire, which has grown to 66,200 acres, or about the size of Sacramento. The Kincade fire is expected to burn for another week and a half, and there’s no rain forecast in sight. At least 3,400 first responders and personnel are fighting the wildfires. Gov. Newsom tweeted this link to a fundraiser for the Wildfire Relief Fund . He says so far $30k has been raised for victims and recovery efforts. KnowThis: The people hit hardest by these natural and man-made disasters are those who are already vulnerable: homeless populations, the elderly, low-income populations without access to emergency prep. This LA Times dispatch describes a housekeeper and gardener who showed up in the midst of ash and fire to their clients’ homes for work without realizing the homeowners had already evacuated.

The National Bureau of Economic Research published a paper studying “fine particulate pollution” and showing that it increased 5.5% from 2016 to 2018 in the U.S. after decreasing almost 25% in the 8 years prior. The study’s authors say “wildfires are incredibly dangerous” and are one contributing factor to the increase in pollution. Different regions of the U.S. saw different rates of pollution — while numbers stayed the same for the Northeast and the South, the Midwest and West both saw significant decreases in air quality. Other contributing factors, as theorized by the study’s authors, are “increased economic activity” (more factory, power plant, and transportation emissions) and “lower enforcement of environmental regulation.”\\nKnowThis: The Trump administration has rolled back 85 environmental regulations since 2016, including enforcement of the Clean Air Act.

President Donald Trump announced the news on Sunday. During a nighttime raid in northwest Syria on Saturday, al-Baghdadi was cornered by U.S. military and died when he detonated a suicide vest he was wearing. According to President Trump, the explosion also killed three of al-Baghdadi’s children. U.S. forces have been searching for the ISIS leader for years, naming him one of the most wanted terrorists in the world. According to a State Department official, the man known as the spokesperson for ISIS, Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir, was killed by U.S. forces in a separate raid.\\nKnowThis: The key information that led U.S. forces to find al-Baghdadi came from a Kurdish informant who gave American military a layout of the terrorist’s compound. Earlier this summer, the informant handed over al-Baghdadi’s used underwear and a sample of his blood so U.S. forces could confirm his identity (they got a positive DNA match for the ISIS leader). Despite the intel sharing, President Trump still decided to withdraw U.S. forces from northern Syria, leaving Kurdish allies vulnerable to a Turkish invasion.\\nGetty Images President Trump Picks A Fight With The City Of Chicago Donald Trump’s first visit to Chicago as sitting president didn’t go so well. After getting booed at the MLB World Series game in Washington, D.C., last night , he flew to Chicago today to speak at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference, where he slammed the local police superintendent for “put[ting] criminals and illegal aliens before the citizens of Chicago.” He also said Afghanistan is safer by comparison . The superintendent who Trump singled out, Eddie Johnson, boycotted the gathering — but he later responded in a press conference and pointed to a decline in violent crime in Chicago over the past few years. Johnson said, “Comments like that being made just lets me know I am doing the right thing and moving Chicago in the direction it should be going.” He also said, “If [Trump] is truly ready, and this president is known for doing a lot of talking about the city of Chicago, but if he is truly, truly ready to roll up his sleeves and partner with us, so are we.”\\nMeanwhile, thousands of protesters gathered outside Trump Tower Chicago, where the president was hosting a fundraiser. While many of the protesters held signs supporting impeachment, Trump called the ongoing inquiry a “scam” and compared it to actor Jussie Smollett’s case. “It&amp;apos;s a real big scam, just like the impeachment of your president is a scam,” he said , referring to the hate crime allegations made by Smollett, which Chicago police later said were fabricated. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot did not hold back in her response, tweeting, \"It&amp;apos;s no surprise that [Trump] brought his insulting, ignorant buffoonery to Chicago. Luckily, in this city, we know the truth and we will not let anyone — no matter how high the office — denigrate who we are as a people or our status as a welcoming city.”\\nKnowThis: Today marks the 8th day of the Chicago Teachers Union strike . President Trump did not mention it in his remarks.\\nLyft Will Offer Free Rides For Unemployed People To Go To Job Interviews Lyft is offering free or discounted rides to job interviews across the U.S. and Canada as part of its newly launched Jobs Access Program. It’s part of the company’s $50 million annual commitment to give communities with barriers to transportation better access to job opportunities, including people with disabilities, low-income communities, and veterans. Lyft says riders who quality will get free or discounted rides to and from job interviews, job training, and even to work for the first three weeks at the job, until they get their first paycheck.\\n“For the unemployed, reliable transportation to a job interview or to the first few weeks of work can mean the difference between successful long-term employment and lost opportunities,” the company said in a statement. Lyft has not yet provided a launch date for the program.\\nThe news comes as affordable transportation is being treated as an emerging priority in Congress. Earlier this month, Reps. Ayanna Pressley, Chuy García, and Mark Takano launched the first-ever Future of Transportation Caucus, “dedicated to creating a vision for the future of our transportation system that emphasizes equity, access, and sustainability.” As Rep. Pressley put it, “Transportation literally affects everything. It’s ultimately just a social justice issue.” You can hear her speak about it more in our exclusive congressional town hall from last week — watch the replay here .\\nKnowThis: According to a company study of its own riders, Lyft found that 44% of rides start or end in low-income area. The company also cited a study on its website that found that commuting time was the single strongest factor in individuals’ effort to escape poverty.\\nVideo Of The Day:</td>\n",

       "1  Chicago's teachers union voted to approve a tentative contract agreement with city officials Wednesday but refused to end a strike that has canceled two weeks of classes unless the city's mayor adds school days to cover that lost time.\\nMayor Lori Lightfoot said Wednesday night that she would not meet that demand. Lightfoot accused the union's top leadership of \"moving the goal posts\" by raising the issue Wednesday rather than in a face-to-face meeting with her on Tuesday.\\n\"Not once during that three-and-a-half-hour meeting did they raise compensation for strike days,\" Lightfoot said heatedly. \"Not once.\"\\nLightfoot refused from the start of the strike to lengthen the school year to make up days. Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson said it would require cutting winter or spring break days or adding days to the end of the year.\\nUnion president Jesse Sharkey said the teachers are not asking to be paid for a strike but do credit the walkout for forcing the district to compromise on some contract issues.\\n\"Over the past two weeks we have obtained gains that are meaningful for students that will make schools better for years to come,\" he said. \"The commitment for nurses, social workers and resources to help homeless students are things that wouldn't have been accomplished if we hadn't walked the picket lines.\"\\nSharkey said teachers consider a refusal to make up school days \"punitive\" and argued that it would ultimately hurt students, including those who must take standardized tests and college admission tests this year.\\n\"We feel like we're just being punished because we had the audacity to defy the mayor,\" Sharkey said. \"And that's not right.\"\\nThe agreement that the 700 members of the union's House of Delegates approved on Wednesday were not immediately released but Sharkey said some of teacher's wins could \"transform\" schools in the district.\\nBroad outlines include a 16% raise for teachers during the five-year contract, a new committee to investigate and enforce classroom sizes that surpass limits in the agreement and funding to add social workers and nurses to the city's neediest schools.\\n\"We've met them on every single issue,\" Lightfoot said. \"The fact that our children are not back in school tomorrow is on them.\"\\nUnion leadership said the tentative agreement does not include additional preparation time for elementary school teachers, which was a sticking point during talks this week.\\nThe strike, which has lasted nearly two weeks, has kept more than 300,000 students out of school. Following the union's decision, CPS canceled classes for the 11th day.\\nEarlier Wednesday, several high school football teams that are at risk of being locked out of the state playoffs if the walkout endures got a temporary reprieve Wednesday.\\nThe Illinois State High School Association said in a news release that the school district agreed to let the teams practice during the strike. They would not be able to play in games on Saturday if the strike hasn't been settled by then.\\nThe announcement came just in time for 19 schools whose teams qualified for the state playoffs because IHSA rules require teams from schools where teachers are on strike to practice for three days before they play a game.\\nThe teams can only practice if they find coaches that have the proper certification or meet various requirements. The district did not immediately respond to a request for comment on how many of the schools had found coaches.\\nCopyright 2019 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

       "2  News KnowThis: Trump vs. Chicago & Relentless Fires Rage in Cali \"We've seen fires and tragedies where people have believed they could stay. Do not do that. The only thing you cannot replace is you and your family.\" by Versha Sharma Published on 10/28/2019 at 11:00PM\\nAssociated Press Relentless Wildfires Rage Across California With No Sign Of Stopping There are now two major raging wildfires threatening both Northern and Southern California, prompting Gov. Gavin Newsom to declare a state of emergency. The Getty Fire, which started overnight in Los Angeles, joins the Kincade Fire that started in Sonoma County last Wednesday. Last night, the Kincade Fire was still burning out of control in its fifth day, dropping from 10% containment to 5% due to hurricane-force winds and dry conditions that have allowed it to spread and made it difficult to control. Several smaller fires are also burning throughout the state, and “ extremely critical fire weather conditions ” will remain.\\nAt around 2 a.m. Monday, a fire erupted near LA’s famed Getty Museum. Police told thousands of people to evacuate, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, LeBron James, and LA Mayor Eric Garcetti’s parents. About 25,000 live in the LA evacuation zone, which covers a swath of high-priced real estate. A fire in December 2017 lit up the same area and forced drivers into a horrifying, apocalyptic-looking morning commute .\\nHere’s the latest:\\nOfficials are still investigating the source of both fires, though Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) has told state regulators one of its power lines malfunctioned, which may have started the Kincade Fire. PG&E is also being criticized for how it handled preemptively cutting off power to 1.3 million California residents. The utility company did it to avoid the possibility of more downed power lines, but many customers complained that they weren’t given enough notice and that the lack of power — which has now lasted for days — is incredibly disruptive, especially to low-income and elderly communities . There have been 200,000 evacuations in Sonoma County because of the Kincade Fire, which has grown to 66,200 acres, or about the size of Sacramento. The Kincade fire is expected to burn for another week and a half, and there’s no rain forecast in sight. At least 3,400 first responders and personnel are fighting the wildfires. Gov. Newsom tweeted this link to a fundraiser for the Wildfire Relief Fund . He says so far $30k has been raised for victims and recovery efforts. KnowThis: The people hit hardest by these natural and man-made disasters are those who are already vulnerable: homeless populations, the elderly, low-income populations without access to emergency prep. This LA Times dispatch describes a housekeeper and gardener who showed up in the midst of ash and fire to their clients’ homes for work without realizing the homeowners had already evacuated.

The National Bureau of Economic Research published a paper studying “fine particulate pollution” and showing that it increased 5.5% from 2016 to 2018 in the U.S. after decreasing almost 25% in the 8 years prior. The study’s authors say “wildfires are incredibly dangerous” and are one contributing factor to the increase in pollution. Different regions of the U.S. saw different rates of pollution — while numbers stayed the same for the Northeast and the South, the Midwest and West both saw significant decreases in air quality. Other contributing factors, as theorized by the study’s authors, are “increased economic activity” (more factory, power plant, and transportation emissions) and “lower enforcement of environmental regulation.”\\nKnowThis: The Trump administration has rolled back 85 environmental regulations since 2016, including enforcement of the Clean Air Act.

President Donald Trump announced the news on Sunday. During a nighttime raid in northwest Syria on Saturday, al-Baghdadi was cornered by U.S. military and died when he detonated a suicide vest he was wearing. According to President Trump, the explosion also killed three of al-Baghdadi’s children. U.S. forces have been searching for the ISIS leader for years, naming him one of the most wanted terrorists in the world. According to a State Department official, the man known as the spokesperson for ISIS, Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir, was killed by U.S. forces in a separate raid.\\nKnowThis: The key information that led U.S. forces to find al-Baghdadi came from a Kurdish informant who gave American military a layout of the terrorist’s compound. Earlier this summer, the informant handed over al-Baghdadi’s used underwear and a sample of his blood so U.S. forces could confirm his identity (they got a positive DNA match for the ISIS leader). Despite the intel sharing, President Trump still decided to withdraw U.S. forces from northern Syria, leaving Kurdish allies vulnerable to a Turkish invasion.\\nGetty Images President Trump Picks A Fight With The City Of Chicago Donald Trump’s first visit to Chicago as sitting president didn’t go so well. After getting booed at the MLB World Series game in Washington, D.C., last night , he flew to Chicago today to speak at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference, where he slammed the local police superintendent for “put[ting] criminals and illegal aliens before the citizens of Chicago.” He also said Afghanistan is safer by comparison . The superintendent who Trump singled out, Eddie Johnson, boycotted the gathering — but he later responded in a press conference and pointed to a decline in violent crime in Chicago over the past few years. Johnson said, “Comments like that being made just lets me know I am doing the right thing and moving Chicago in the direction it should be going.” He also said, “If [Trump] is truly ready, and this president is known for doing a lot of talking about the city of Chicago, but if he is truly, truly ready to roll up his sleeves and partner with us, so are we.”\\nMeanwhile, thousands of protesters gathered outside Trump Tower Chicago, where the president was hosting a fundraiser. While many of the protesters held signs supporting impeachment, Trump called the ongoing inquiry a “scam” and compared it to actor Jussie Smollett’s case. “It&apos;s a real big scam, just like the impeachment of your president is a scam,” he said , referring to the hate crime allegations made by Smollett, which Chicago police later said were fabricated. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot did not hold back in her response, tweeting, \"It&apos;s no surprise that [Trump] brought his insulting, ignorant buffoonery to Chicago. Luckily, in this city, we know the truth and we will not let anyone — no matter how high the office — denigrate who we are as a people or our status as a welcoming city.”\\nKnowThis: Today marks the 8th day of the Chicago Teachers Union strike . President Trump did not mention it in his remarks.\\nLyft Will Offer Free Rides For Unemployed People To Go To Job Interviews Lyft is offering free or discounted rides to job interviews across the U.S. and Canada as part of its newly launched Jobs Access Program. It’s part of the company’s $50 million annual commitment to give communities with barriers to transportation better access to job opportunities, including people with disabilities, low-income communities, and veterans. Lyft says riders who quality will get free or discounted rides to and from job interviews, job training, and even to work for the first three weeks at the job, until they get their first paycheck.\\n“For the unemployed, reliable transportation to a job interview or to the first few weeks of work can mean the difference between successful long-term employment and lost opportunities,” the company said in a statement. Lyft has not yet provided a launch date for the program.\\nThe news comes as affordable transportation is being treated as an emerging priority in Congress. Earlier this month, Reps. Ayanna Pressley, Chuy García, and Mark Takano launched the first-ever Future of Transportation Caucus, “dedicated to creating a vision for the future of our transportation system that emphasizes equity, access, and sustainability.” As Rep. Pressley put it, “Transportation literally affects everything. It’s ultimately just a social justice issue.” You can hear her speak about it more in our exclusive congressional town hall from last week — watch the replay here .\\nKnowThis: According to a company study of its own riders, Lyft found that 44% of rides start or end in low-income area. The company also cited a study on its website that found that commuting time was the single strongest factor in individuals’ effort to escape poverty.\\nVideo Of The Day:    \n",

       "      <td>\\nAlso: NBC pulls two shows – but one is moving to digital. Fox 32 downgrades local show; Bless The Harts renewed for season two\\nTo say Chicago stations had a busy week is quite an understatement: in addition to reminding viewers (constantly) about re-scanning their sets, news stations were covering the second Chicago Public School Teachers strike in the last seven years. As expected, the teachers walked off the job Thursday, leaving 300,000 students without classes. And the rhetoric at times between the two sides has approached – and surpassed FCC/Illinois legislature (under Gov. Rauner’s leadership, at least) dysfunction.\\nUnlike 2012, when local stations weren’t able to break into network programming due to sports commitments and had to scramble when a strike was hastily announced , the announcement was more subdued this time around as everyone expected a work stoppage to take place as negotiations weren’t really going anywhere.\\nOn Thursday afternoon, local stations were leading off their newscasts with the strike , but by evening, it wasn’t the top story anymore – for example, WGN-TV didn’t get to the strike until 9:10 p.m. as other stories (such as Police Supt. Eddie Johnson’s medical episode and a Northwest Side carjacking) took prominence.\\nCTU strike already seems to be an afterthought as WGN doesn't mention story until 10 minutes into their 9 p.m. newscast. Ouch.\\n— T Dog Media (@tdogmedia) October 18, 2019\\nStill, local stations have devoted a lot of resources to cover the strike, including information for parents on their respective websites (if you can find it.) But with CPS and the teacher’s union in a standoff over numerous issues as of this writing, don’t look for a resolution anytime soon – something you’re used to if you’re a sports fan and Dish subscriber.\\nAnd if you thought these negotiations between CPS and the teacher’s union were a disaster, wait until next year when the Writer’s Guild and the AMPTP get together to discuss a new contract. You haven’t seen nothing yet.\\nIf what could be construed as the first downgrade of the season outside of prime-time, Fox-owned WFLD has moved late night local show Later With Leon from 10 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. Hosted by WGCI radio personality Leon Rogers and co-hosted by reporter Tia Ewing, the show looked at the the day’s top stories. Both the iHeartMedia station and WFLD are located in close proximity with each other, in the Illinois Center complex on 205 and 233 North Michigan Avenue (for the record, I hung out at the Wow Bao every morning near WFLD’s entrances most mornings before going to work.)\\nAlthough no official reason was given for the time slot change, it was understood the four day-a-week strip was performing poorly in the ratings. Also not helping is Thursday’s show was often delayed by NFL games, pushing the show out of its 10 p.m. slot.\\nWFLD is still promoting the show; tickets are available to attend a taping .\\nOn another front, WGN has now added Backstory With Larry Potash at 10 p.m. Saturday nights, with a repeat Sunday nights at 11 p.m. The local series replaced another WGN local show Man Of The People with fellow morning show anchor Pat Tomasulo in those same slots, which was canceled in July after eighteen months on the air.

We want to thank creator and executive producer Emily Spivey, whose unique voice and personal experience brought this family to life, as well as executive producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller, and our partners at 20th Century Fox Television.

       "      <td>\\nAlso: NBC pulls two shows – but one is moving to digital. Fox 32 downgrades local show; Bless The Harts renewed for season two\\nTo say Chicago stations had a busy week is quite an understatement: in addition to reminding viewers (constantly) about re-scanning their sets, news stations were covering the second Chicago Public School Teachers strike in the last seven years. As expected, the teachers walked off the job Thursday, leaving 300,000 students without classes. And the rhetoric at times between the two sides has approached – and surpassed FCC/Illinois legislature (under Gov. Rauner’s leadership, at least) dysfunction.\\nUnlike 2012, when local stations weren’t able to break into network programming due to sports commitments and had to scramble when a strike was hastily announced , the announcement was more subdued this time around as everyone expected a work stoppage to take place as negotiations weren’t really going anywhere.\\nOn Thursday afternoon, local stations were leading off their newscasts with the strike , but by evening, it wasn’t the top story anymore – for example, WGN-TV didn’t get to the strike until 9:10 p.m. as other stories (such as Police Supt. Eddie Johnson’s medical episode and a Northwest Side carjacking) took prominence.\\nCTU strike already seems to be an afterthought as WGN doesn't mention story until 10 minutes into their 9 p.m. newscast. Ouch.\\n— T Dog Media (@tdogmedia) October 18, 2019\\nStill, local stations have devoted a lot of resources to cover the strike, including information for parents on their respective websites (if you can find it.) But with CPS and the teacher’s union in a standoff over numerous issues as of this writing, don’t look for a resolution anytime soon – something you’re used to if you’re a sports fan and Dish subscriber.\\nAnd if you thought these negotiations between CPS and the teacher’s union were a disaster, wait until next year when the Writer’s Guild and the AMPTP get together to discuss a new contract. You haven’t seen nothing yet.\\nIf what could be construed as the first downgrade of the season outside of prime-time, Fox-owned WFLD has moved late night local show Later With Leon from 10 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. Hosted by WGCI radio personality Leon Rogers and co-hosted by reporter Tia Ewing, the show looked at the the day’s top stories. Both the iHeartMedia station and WFLD are located in close proximity with each other, in the Illinois Center complex on 205 and 233 North Michigan Avenue (for the record, I hung out at the Wow Bao every morning near WFLD’s entrances most mornings before going to work.)\\nAlthough no official reason was given for the time slot change, it was understood the four day-a-week strip was performing poorly in the ratings. Also not helping is Thursday’s show was often delayed by NFL games, pushing the show out of its 10 p.m. slot.\\nWFLD is still promoting the show; tickets are available to attend a taping .\\nOn another front, WGN has now added Backstory With Larry Potash at 10 p.m. Saturday nights, with a repeat Sunday nights at 11 p.m. The local series replaced another WGN local show Man Of The People with fellow morning show anchor Pat Tomasulo in those same slots, which was canceled in July after eighteen months on the air. Backstory features long-lost facts and history many Chicagoans don’t know about, similar to what WTTW’s Geoffrey Baer does on Chicago Tonight and on numerous specials.\\nNBC comedy Sunnyside and Memphis-set legal drama Bluff City Law will each end their run when their episode order is complete.

Gavin Newsom to declare a state of emergency. The Getty Fire, which started overnight in Los Angeles, joins the Kincade Fire that started in Sonoma County last Wednesday. Last night, the Kincade Fire was still burning out of control in its fifth day, dropping from  containment to  due to hurricaneforce winds and dry conditions that have allowed it to spread and made it difficult to control. Several smaller fires are also burning throughout the state, and  extremely critical fire weather conditions  will remain.At around  a.m. Monday, a fire erupted near LAs famed Getty Museum. Police told thousands of people to evacuate, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, LeBron James, and LA Mayor Eric Garcettis parents. About , live in the LA evacuation zone, which covers a swath of highpriced real estate. A fire in December  lit up the same area and forced drivers into a horrifying, apocalypticlooking morning commute .Heres the latest:Officials are still investigating the source of both fires, though Pacific Gas and Electric PGE has told state regulators one of its power lines malfunctioned, which may have started the Kincade Fire. PGE is also being criticized for how it handled preemptively cutting off power to . million California residents. The utility company did it to avoid the possibility of more downed power lines, but many customers complained that they werent given enough notice and that the lack of power  which has now lasted for days  is incredibly disruptive, especially to lowincome and elderly communities . There have been , evacuations in Sonoma County because of the Kincade Fire, which has grown to , acres, or about the size of Sacramento. The Kincade fire is expected to burn for another week and a half, and theres no rain forecast in sight. At least , first responders and personnel are fighting the wildfires. Gov. Newsom tweeted this link to a fundraiser for the Wildfire Relief Fund . He says so far k has been raised for victims and recovery efforts.

The National Bureau of Economic Research published a paper studying fine particulate pollution and showing that it increased . from  to  in the U.S. after decreasing almost  in the  years prior. The studys authors say wildfires are incredibly dangerous and are one contributing factor to the increase in pollution. Different regions of the U.S. saw different rates of pollution  while numbers stayed the same for the Northeast and the South, the Midwest and West both saw significant decreases in air quality. Other contributing factors, as theorized by the studys authors, are increased economic activity more factory, power plant, and transportation emissions and lower enforcement of environmental regulation.KnowThis: The Trump administration has rolled back  environmental regulations since , including enforcement of the Clean Air Act.

President Donald Trump announced the news on Sunday. During a nighttime raid in northwest Syria on Saturday, alBaghdadi was cornered by U.S. military and died when he detonated a suicide vest he was wearing. According to President Trump, the explosion also killed three of alBaghdadis children. U.S. forces have been searching for the ISIS leader for years, naming him one of the most wanted terrorists in the world. According to a State Department official, the man known as the spokesperson for ISIS, Abu alHassan alMuhajir, was killed by U.S. forces in a separate raid.KnowThis: The key information that led U.S. forces to find alBaghdadi came from a Kurdish informant who gave American military a layout of the terrorists compound. Earlier this summer, the informant handed over alBaghdadis used underwear and a sample of his blood so U.S. forces could confirm his identity they got a positive DNA match for the ISIS leader. Despite the intel sharing, President Trump still decided to withdraw U.S. forces from northern Syria, leaving Kurdish allies vulnerable to a Turkish invasion.Getty Images President Trump Picks A Fight With The City Of Chicago Donald Trumps first visit to Chicago as sitting president didnt go so well. After getting booed at the MLB World Series game in Washington, D.C., last night , he flew to Chicago today to speak at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference, where he slammed the local police superintendent for putting criminals and illegal aliens before the citizens of Chicago. He also said Afghanistan is safer by comparison . The superintendent who Trump singled out, Eddie Johnson, boycotted the gathering  but he later responded in a press conference and pointed to a decline in violent crime in Chicago over the past few years. Johnson said, Comments like that being made just lets me know I am doing the right thing and moving Chicago in the direction it should be going. He also said, If Trump is truly ready, and this president is known for doing a lot of talking about the city of Chicago, but if he is truly, truly ready to roll up his sleeves and partner with us, so are we.Meanwhile, thousands of protesters gathered outside Trump Tower Chicago, where the president was hosting a fundraiser. While many of the protesters held signs supporting impeachment, Trump called the ongoing inquiry a scam and compared it to actor Jussie Smolletts case. Itaposs a real big scam, just like the impeachment of your president is a scam, he said , referring to the hate crime allegations made by Smollett, which Chicago police later said were fabricated. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot did not hold back in her response, tweeting, Itaposs no surprise that Trump brought his insulting, ignorant buffoonery to Chicago. Luckily, in this city, we know the truth and we will not let anyone  no matter how high the office  denigrate who we are as a people or our status as a welcoming city.KnowThis: Today marks the th day of the Chicago Teachers Union strike .

       "      <td>Why pressure on property taxes is growing in Illinois amid pension burden The cost of public safety pensions has limited the number of financial options for the city of Waukegan, which finances operating costs through bonds. Jared RuteckiBGA Better Government Association Updated  : AM Across Illinois, in many of the small towns and larger cities that manage some  independent police and fire retirement systems, those funds have placed an increasingly tightening vise on municipal finances. Much of the focus on the pension problem in Illinois has been on the massive liabilities facing the five statewide funds as well as Chicagos citywide pensions. But in many ways the more pressing pension issues can be found in the towns in every corner of the state. The number claiming pensions from roughly  suburban and downstate police and fire funds increased nearly  over  years.  In Illinois  largest cities beyond Chicago  those with populations of , or more  the rate of pension payment increases has outstripped the growth of property tax revenue by a factor of about  since , a Better Government Association review of financial and pension documents shows. Five cities saw a net decline in property tax revenue between  and , while eight reported a cumulative gain of less than  percent. During the same time period, the median increase of pension payments to the police retirement systems jumped roughly  percent for firefighters it was about  percent. Illinois has imposed a structure for police and firefighter pensions that is inherently inefficient but also distinct from the problems facing the statewide funds. Some cities, many downstate, are hampered by declining tax bases as people and jobs leave. A towns hands are tied with how it invests pension cash as well as the small size of its pension pools. by signing up you agree to our terms of service No one would set up a system like this if they had it to do it again, said Brad Cole, executive director of the Illinois Municipal League. On average, the pensions are funded at  percent, which is  percentage points below the  average. There is no single city that perfectly exemplifies Illinois pension predicament. There is, however, a common bottom line: mounting pressure on property taxes. National surveys have shown Illinois near the top in terms of property taxes, mostly the result of the state being near the bottom in supporting public education. Pension demands are putting even more pressure on property taxes, forcing city leaders to make tough choices about cutting back on services or adding to the tax bills. Theres not enough natural growth in our revenue sources to keep up with pension costs, and, at some point, citizens say enough is enough and you cant raise taxes, said Bill McCarty, who as Springfields budget director for more than eight years has seen up close the slow strangulation of the citys finances. Last year every dollar of property tax revenue collected in Springfield went into the pension funds. Next year the bill will go up another . million, he said. Over  years, the cumulative effect of pension obligations is projected to exceed property tax collections by nearly  million. Thats completely unsustainable, McCarty said. Amid the increased pressure on municipalities, Gov. J.B. Pritzker earlier this month proposed a partial solution: consolidate the investment operations of the funds, with the intent of saving money and improving the financial returns on investments. The current system, the governor said, reveals the individual funds, on the whole, are underperforming by nearly  million per day. Thats not just a missed opportunity  thats a hole these funds are digging deeper every year. State lawmakers are expected to consider the measure during the fall veto session, which started Monday. While many mayors and budget officials applaud the governors bill, there is a general belief that this step is not the cavalry coming to the rescue. The numbers  unfunded liabilities, annual cost increases, statemandated funding targets, longer life expectancy  are too daunting to be tamed by consolidation alone. You need to have structural reform to what the pensions look like going forward if theres any chance for the municipalities to survive and not end up like the state of Illinois, where youre dropping into  or  percent for the funding level, said Reid Ottesen, the longtime village manager in Palatine. Amanda Kass of the University of Illinois at Chicago, who for years has been monitoring the performance of police and firefighter pensions, notes that while the state has its own serious problems with more than  billion in unfunded liabilities and an average funding level of about  percent, one of the lowest among the states, local governments have fewer tools to maintain the public safety pensions. The urgency, for them, is greater. Its a hornets nest with a snake inside, said Kass, associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at UICs College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs. If total revenue isnt keeping pace with the yeartoyear increase, Kass said about the strain on municipalities, we know that more revenue is having to be devoted to making pension payments. Which means service cuts, or not addressing service or infrastructure needs. Whats more, the obstacles are rooted in the demographic and economic disparities that define Illinois, a state where nine out of  counties are losing population and job growth is increasingly gravitating to metropolitan Chicago. In Rockford, the citys cost to maintain the police pension fund jumped  percent between  and , according to Rockfords financial reports. The firefighter payments doubled. In , the city was spending . million on public safety pensions. In , the budgeted amount is  million, Rockford Mayor Tom McNamara said. In , he said, it will rise to  million. And by , it will consume all of the citys property taxes, which is the primary revenue source of the general fund. The city implemented a utility tax to help relieve the pressure, but its not enough. Something has to be done in the short term and long term to allow municipalities that are the size of Rockford to have some breathing room or some relief from these pension obligations, McNamara said. We can only cut so much staff before we have to cut core city services, which we dont want to do. Weve got a lot of work ahead of us. In Peoria, which in  saw the headquarters of Caterpillar Inc. leave for the suburb of Deerfield, the pension squeeze was already tight before the company left town. In the past five years, Mayor Jim Ardis said, the city workforce has been cut by about  percent, to . The majority of the cuts came from the ranks of police and fire, he said. The city outsourced engineering services and eliminated animal control. Early retirement offers are common, and many vacancies go unfilled, Ardis said. In a controversial move, Peoria enacted a public safety pension fee  about  per property owner  which Ardis said should generate about . million annually. Theres no such thing as a fee. People know its a tax, Ardis said. It doesnt matter what you call it. People know it when they see it. Waukegan, the old port city, used to boast industrial prosperity. Today its industrial legacy includes multiple Environmental Protection Agency Superfund sites. It has nearly  million in unfunded public safety pension liabilities and the citys , residents feel the effects of budget austerity as pension costs soar. For a decade, none of the money collected through the property tax levy has been spent on daytoday services, said Tina Smigielski, the citys finance director. Services such as residential garbage collection have been contracted out. Layoffs and early retirement have brought the employee count down from a decade ago. Money from a proposed casino wont help until the doors are opened. So, the city has paid its operating costs through bonds, said Mayor Sam Cunningham, who is aware of the longterm risks. We can debt ourselves right out of business if we borrow rather than pay for services on an annual basis. We want to take care of those who provide services to our communities. I would feel like a jerk if I wasnt able to provide for their retirement after they put in their blood, sweat, tears and love into the city, Cunningham said. But we also have to balance what we have to do today. Even towns seeing a growth in population are feeling the pension reality bearing down. Naperville, for instance, puts more money into the two funds than is required and has been able to maintain the police system at  percent funded and the firefighters at  percent. Thats not great but its near the top among all funds, nearly all of which are financially weaker than they were  years ago. Napervilles population and economic prospects have soared since , with the residential count increasing by nearly  percent to ,. Elgin has seen growth but it hasnt kept pace with pension demands. Despite a recent bump in population, Elgin Mayor Dave Kaptain said property tax revenue and riverboat casino earnings arent the reliable cash registers they used to be. As a result, the city borrowed  million a few years ago because it was behind on street repairs and pension costs were partly to blame, Kaptain said. Across the state since , there has been a nearly  percent increase in the number of retirees collecting pensions while the number of public safety employees paying into those systems has flatlined. Some smaller communities face even greater financial peril, Kass said, because they dont have the tax base to meet pension funding obligations and, because their pension systems are smaller, they are restricted in the kinds of investments they can make. Danville, population ,, closed one of its four fire stations in  amid mounting pension pressures. It enacted a special tax assessment devoted specifically to public safety retirement systems. The firefighters pension in Danville is  percent funded while the police is at  percent, according to state records. Kass said the recession of  seriously undermined pension funding levels and there has not been a real recovery in the past decade. Back in Springfield, McCarty, who served in budget positions in the administrations of governors George Ryan and Rod Blagojevich, argues the statemandated target that pensions reach a funding level of  percent by  has added unnecessary cost to the system. He and officials from other cities say the target should be much lower  perhaps  percent  considering a citys ability to make annual benefit payments and still have a financial cushion in anticipation of investment losses or market downturns. Its an arbitrary number on a piece of paper that probably would make the rating agencies feel good, McCarty said of the current  percent target. Its a vicious circle.  What theyre really doing is advocating for communities to increase taxes or cut services, making their communities less desirable to live in and they wont live there. So, the money the city needs to pay for pensions and services wont be there.  This story was produced by the Better Government Association, a nonprofit news organization based in Chicago.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Reports: Underrepresented Students at Illinois Institutions Impacted by Budget Cuts October ,   : PrintA recent period of higher education cutbacks in Illinois has created affordability and equity gaps for underrepresented students.Thats according to new reports by the Partnership of College Completion PCC. The reports note that from  to , funding for Illinois public universities was cut over  percent and community colleges saw a similar disinvestment. This caused many institutions to increase the cost of tuition to make up for the loss.When you cut education, you dont cut the costs, you just shift the costs from the state to institutions, then from the institutions to students, said Michael Abrahamson, policy analyst at PCC. So, it disproportionality hurts students who have the least ability to pay and institutions that have the smallest financial market. It affects Black and Latinx students in Illinois in different ways but all to some degree because of how those costs are being shifted to students. Michael AbrahamsonIn order to analyze the statewide underfunding impact on Black and Latinx students, PCC recently released two reports as part of a threepart series. The findings were organized based on major themes including access, cost and the ability to pay.We rarely talk about the impact on students and we rarely talk about the ways in which the state of Illinois really retreating from its historic investment in higher education has impacted the life trajectories of hundreds of thousands of students over the last  years, said Kyle P. Westbrook, founding executive director at PCC.In the study , Priced Out: Black Students On Illinois Disinvestment In Higher Education and What Can Be Done About It , researchers reveal that in , , fewer Black students attended Illinois public and private nonprofit colleges compared to , regardless of the similar numbers of high school graduates.Westbrook said that some of the enrollment decline was caused by the recession. It was expected that once the recession ended, enrollment would be equivalent to where it was prerecession, if not more. However, that was not the case.That was really shocking and should be a cause for alarm, he added.Only four of the  public universities and four of the  private nonprofit colleges in Illinois have a Black student population that is representative of the states population, according to the report.In terms of financial inequity gaps, the median Illinois Black household earns , compared to , for White households and is three times more likely to have an annual income below the federal poverty line. Additionally, the rate of debt is higher as  percent of Black graduates owed more than , in loans, compared to  percent of White graduates, the report also found.PCCs most recent study , Priced Out: Latinx Students On Illinois Disinvestment In Higher Education and What Can Be Done About It, showed similar gaps.Latinx community college students have a completion rate of  percent, compared to  percent for White community college students. At fouryear public universities, Latinx students graduate at a rate of  percent, compared to  percent for White students. National research shows that Latinx student borrowers are  percent more likely to default on student loans than White students, according to PCCs report.Although Illinois saw an  percent increase of Latinx high school graduates as well as college enrollment double from  to , the rate of earning fouryear degrees did not share the same growth. This is due to low transfer and completion rates. Additionally, in terms of tuition cost, Latinx families pay  percent of their income to attend public universities and  percent for private universities, compared to White families who pay  percent and  percent, the report found. Kyle WestbrookIn general, in order to address these equity issues, institutions need to focus on remedial courses and developmental education to ensure that Illinois is giving students the best possible chance to succeed, according to Westbrook.At the state level, Illinois needs to reinvest in its institutions. Both reports advocated and recommended an equitydriven funding formula for higher education, meaning the institutions who serve the highest percentage of lowincome or underrepresented students should receive a higher appropriation than public institutions that are not serving representative portions of student populations in terms of race and socioeconomic status, said Westbrook.Within the next week, PCC will release the last report titled Priced Out: Rural Students which focuses on the divide between those who can afford to leave their hometown for fouryear degrees from public and private institutions and those that stay in the area to earn twoyear degrees .Higher costs means they incur more debt and higher debt means that these students can less afford to move back to their hometown, said Abrahamson. Theres a lot of national research that says a lot of rural students do want to move back and raise families in the places they are from but with large amounts of student debt, because they stand to make more in cities, its a less tenable proposition which is both inequitable and bad for the state.In order to see results within the states higher education system, the reports should be shared with both institutions and policy makers, said Abrahamson.I hope these reports will be a good launching pad for conversations on these topics, he said. I think we have to have these conversations with the public and that this is about investment, its about the future of our state and equity.Sarah Wood can be reached at .</td>\n",

As if thats the real problem that needs to be solved. In fact, everybody breathed a sigh of relief when Mayor Lightfoot didnt resort to a property tax hike to close the gap. That shouldnt have been the big achievement.Thats the problem. By focusing onone year budgets, its like were treating an intensive care patient with aspirin. Chicagos problems are far larger than a oneyear deficit. Its problems are multiyear, multigovernment and structural.When you add them all up, Chicagos problems make it an extreme outlier nationally. Chicago households are burdened with far more debt than any other major city in the country.The citys credit rating sits alone with Detroit at junk. CPS is even worse than Detroit.Chicago is also an outlier among the big cities in its population drop  nobody else has lost people four years in a row.And property values, in real terms, are worth less today than they were in . Chicagos growth drags far below that of other big cities.Focusing on oneyear budgets only perpetuates those problems.Our position at Wirepoints is that Chicagoans are stuck with more retirement debts than they can ever repay. Add up the debt of overlapping governments and put that burden on those households with the means to pay  say those making , or more  and youre looking at a burden of , per household. Thats an impossible amount.That burden will force more Chicagoans to flee, joining the , residents who already left between  and . And the citys downward spiral will continue.Chicago is in a mess because its politicians have failed to attack the citys longterm problems: the cumulative, overlapping debts and the collective bargaining laws that end up inflating those debts year after year.Thats why weve got to stop looking at these problems on a shortterm, piecemeal basis. Because when we do it that way, one government in isolation, it allows lawmakers to get away with things that make no sense.How else do you explain Mayor Lightfoot going to Gov. Pritzker to ask for a state takeover of city pensions, and then right after that, she offers what she calls the most lucrative contract in the CTUs historyIf you are an ordinary Chicagoan, that doesnt make any sense. And it shouldnt. But its the system that we have. It enables the bad behavior by both politicians and the unions.Every year its the same thing. Politicians try to put a patch on something thats fundamentally broken.But if they were to try and do things right, Mayor Lightfoot would change course and put together a workout team  a restructuring group  that determines how to reduce Chicagos debts so that the city can become competitive again in taxation, services, and its economic environment.Shed also use the bully pulpit as mayor of the nations rdbiggest city to demand an amendment to the pension protection clause and a rollback in collective bargaining laws. After the strike, she may consider that.What Ive just said is unlikely, yes, but Id argue entirely necessary. And inevitable. The alternative is collapse. And nobody wants that.</td>\n",

       "2  Why pressure on property taxes is growing in Illinois amid pension burden The cost of public safety pensions has limited the number of financial options for the city of Waukegan, which finances operating costs through bonds. Jared RuteckiBGA Better Government Association Updated  : AM Across Illinois, in many of the small towns and larger cities that manage some  independent police and fire retirement systems, those funds have placed an increasingly tightening vise on municipal finances. Much of the focus on the pension problem in Illinois has been on the massive liabilities facing the five statewide funds as well as Chicagos citywide pensions. But in many ways the more pressing pension issues can be found in the towns in every corner of the state. The number claiming pensions from roughly  suburban and downstate police and fire funds increased nearly  over  years.  In Illinois  largest cities beyond Chicago  those with populations of , or more  the rate of pension payment increases has outstripped the growth of property tax revenue by a factor of about  since , a Better Government Association review of financial and pension documents shows. Five cities saw a net decline in property tax revenue between  and , while eight reported a cumulative gain of less than  percent. During the same time period, the median increase of pension payments to the police retirement systems jumped roughly  percent for firefighters it was about  percent. Illinois has imposed a structure for police and firefighter pensions that is inherently inefficient but also distinct from the problems facing the statewide funds. Some cities, many downstate, are hampered by declining tax bases as people and jobs leave. A towns hands are tied with how it invests pension cash as well as the small size of its pension pools. by signing up you agree to our terms of service No one would set up a system like this if they had it to do it again, said Brad Cole, executive director of the Illinois Municipal League. On average, the pensions are funded at  percent, which is  percentage points below the  average. There is no single city that perfectly exemplifies Illinois pension predicament. There is, however, a common bottom line: mounting pressure on property taxes. National surveys have shown Illinois near the top in terms of property taxes, mostly the result of the state being near the bottom in supporting public education. Pension demands are putting even more pressure on property taxes, forcing city leaders to make tough choices about cutting back on services or adding to the tax bills. Theres not enough natural growth in our revenue sources to keep up with pension costs, and, at some point, citizens say enough is enough and you cant raise taxes, said Bill McCarty, who as Springfields budget director for more than eight years has seen up close the slow strangulation of the citys finances. Last year every dollar of property tax revenue collected in Springfield went into the pension funds. Next year the bill will go up another . million, he said. Over  years, the cumulative effect of pension obligations is projected to exceed property tax collections by nearly  million. Thats completely unsustainable, McCarty said. Amid the increased pressure on municipalities, Gov. J.B. Pritzker earlier this month proposed a partial solution: consolidate the investment operations of the funds, with the intent of saving money and improving the financial returns on investments. The current system, the governor said, reveals the individual funds, on the whole, are underperforming by nearly  million per day. Thats not just a missed opportunity  thats a hole these funds are digging deeper every year. State lawmakers are expected to consider the measure during the fall veto session, which started Monday. While many mayors and budget officials applaud the governors bill, there is a general belief that this step is not the cavalry coming to the rescue. The numbers  unfunded liabilities, annual cost increases, statemandated funding targets, longer life expectancy  are too daunting to be tamed by consolidation alone. You need to have structural reform to what the pensions look like going forward if theres any chance for the municipalities to survive and not end up like the state of Illinois, where youre dropping into  or  percent for the funding level, said Reid Ottesen, the longtime village manager in Palatine. Amanda Kass of the University of Illinois at Chicago, who for years has been monitoring the performance of police and firefighter pensions, notes that while the state has its own serious problems with more than  billion in unfunded liabilities and an average funding level of about  percent, one of the lowest among the states, local governments have fewer tools to maintain the public safety pensions. The urgency, for them, is greater. Its a hornets nest with a snake inside, said Kass, associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at UICs College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs. If total revenue isnt keeping pace with the yeartoyear increase, Kass said about the strain on municipalities, we know that more revenue is having to be devoted to making pension payments. Which means service cuts, or not addressing service or infrastructure needs. Whats more, the obstacles are rooted in the demographic and economic disparities that define Illinois, a state where nine out of  counties are losing population and job growth is increasingly gravitating to metropolitan Chicago. In Rockford, the citys cost to maintain the police pension fund jumped  percent between  and , according to Rockfords financial reports. The firefighter payments doubled. In , the city was spending . million on public safety pensions. In , the budgeted amount is  million, Rockford Mayor Tom McNamara said. In , he said, it will rise to  million. And by , it will consume all of the citys property taxes, which is the primary revenue source of the general fund. The city implemented a utility tax to help relieve the pressure, but its not enough. Something has to be done in the short term and long term to allow municipalities that are the size of Rockford to have some breathing room or some relief from these pension obligations, McNamara said. We can only cut so much staff before we have to cut core city services, which we dont want to do. Weve got a lot of work ahead of us. In Peoria, which in  saw the headquarters of Caterpillar Inc. leave for the suburb of Deerfield, the pension squeeze was already tight before the company left town. In the past five years, Mayor Jim Ardis said, the city workforce has been cut by about  percent, to . The majority of the cuts came from the ranks of police and fire, he said. The city outsourced engineering services and eliminated animal control. Early retirement offers are common, and many vacancies go unfilled, Ardis said. In a controversial move, Peoria enacted a public safety pension fee  about  per property owner  which Ardis said should generate about . million annually. Theres no such thing as a fee. People know its a tax, Ardis said. It doesnt matter what you call it. People know it when they see it. Waukegan, the old port city, used to boast industrial prosperity. Today its industrial legacy includes multiple Environmental Protection Agency Superfund sites. It has nearly  million in unfunded public safety pension liabilities and the citys , residents feel the effects of budget austerity as pension costs soar. For a decade, none of the money collected through the property tax levy has been spent on daytoday services, said Tina Smigielski, the citys finance director. Services such as residential garbage collection have been contracted out. Layoffs and early retirement have brought the employee count down from a decade ago. Money from a proposed casino wont help until the doors are opened. So, the city has paid its operating costs through bonds, said Mayor Sam Cunningham, who is aware of the longterm risks. We can debt ourselves right out of business if we borrow rather than pay for services on an annual basis. We want to take care of those who provide services to our communities. I would feel like a jerk if I wasnt able to provide for their retirement after they put in their blood, sweat, tears and love into the city, Cunningham said. But we also have to balance what we have to do today. Even towns seeing a growth in population are feeling the pension reality bearing down. Naperville, for instance, puts more money into the two funds than is required and has been able to maintain the police system at  percent funded and the firefighters at  percent. Thats not great but its near the top among all funds, nearly all of which are financially weaker than they were  years ago. Napervilles population and economic prospects have soared since , with the residential count increasing by nearly  percent to ,. Elgin has seen growth but it hasnt kept pace with pension demands. Despite a recent bump in population, Elgin Mayor Dave Kaptain said property tax revenue and riverboat casino earnings arent the reliable cash registers they used to be. As a result, the city borrowed  million a few years ago because it was behind on street repairs and pension costs were partly to blame, Kaptain said. Across the state since , there has been a nearly  percent increase in the number of retirees collecting pensions while the number of public safety employees paying into those systems has flatlined. Some smaller communities face even greater financial peril, Kass said, because they dont have the tax base to meet pension funding obligations and, because their pension systems are smaller, they are restricted in the kinds of investments they can make. Danville, population ,, closed one of its four fire stations in  amid mounting pension pressures. It enacted a special tax assessment devoted specifically to public safety retirement systems. The firefighters pension in Danville is  percent funded while the police is at  percent, according to state records. Kass said the recession of  seriously undermined pension funding levels and there has not been a real recovery in the past decade. Back in Springfield, McCarty, who served in budget positions in the administrations of governors George Ryan and Rod Blagojevich, argues the statemandated target that pensions reach a funding level of  percent by  has added unnecessary cost to the system. He and officials from other cities say the target should be much lower  perhaps  percent  considering a citys ability to make annual benefit payments and still have a financial cushion in anticipation of investment losses or market downturns. Its an arbitrary number on a piece of paper that probably would make the rating agencies feel good, McCarty said of the current  percent target. Its a vicious circle.  What theyre really doing is advocating for communities to increase taxes or cut services, making their communities less desirable to live in and they wont live there. So, the money the city needs to pay for pensions and services wont be there.  This story was produced by the Better Government Association, a nonprofit news organization based in Chicago.   \n",
       "3  Reports: Underrepresented Students at Illinois Institutions Impacted by Budget Cuts October ,   : PrintA recent period of higher education cutbacks in Illinois has created affordability and equity gaps for underrepresented students.Thats according to new reports by the Partnership of College Completion PCC. The reports note that from  to , funding for Illinois public universities was cut over  percent and community colleges saw a similar disinvestment. This caused many institutions to increase the cost of tuition to make up for the loss.When you cut education, you dont cut the costs, you just shift the costs from the state to institutions, then from the institutions to students, said Michael Abrahamson, policy analyst at PCC. So, it disproportionality hurts students who have the least ability to pay and institutions that have the smallest financial market. It affects Black and Latinx students in Illinois in different ways but all to some degree because of how those costs are being shifted to students. Michael AbrahamsonIn order to analyze the statewide underfunding impact on Black and Latinx students, PCC recently released two reports as part of a threepart series. The findings were organized based on major themes including access, cost and the ability to pay.We rarely talk about the impact on students and we rarely talk about the ways in which the state of Illinois really retreating from its historic investment in higher education has impacted the life trajectories of hundreds of thousands of students over the last  years, said Kyle P. Westbrook, founding executive director at PCC.In the study , Priced Out: Black Students On Illinois Disinvestment In Higher Education and What Can Be Done About It , researchers reveal that in , , fewer Black students attended Illinois public and private nonprofit colleges compared to , regardless of the similar numbers of high school graduates.Westbrook said that some of the enrollment decline was caused by the recession. It was expected that once the recession ended, enrollment would be equivalent to where it was prerecession, if not more. However, that was not the case.That was really shocking and should be a cause for alarm, he added.Only four of the  public universities and four of the  private nonprofit colleges in Illinois have a Black student population that is representative of the states population, according to the report.In terms of financial inequity gaps, the median Illinois Black household earns , compared to , for White households and is three times more likely to have an annual income below the federal poverty line. Additionally, the rate of debt is higher as  percent of Black graduates owed more than , in loans, compared to  percent of White graduates, the report also found.PCCs most recent study , Priced Out: Latinx Students On Illinois Disinvestment In Higher Education and What Can Be Done About It, showed similar gaps.Latinx community college students have a completion rate of  percent, compared to  percent for White community college students. At fouryear public universities, Latinx students graduate at a rate of  percent, compared to  percent for White students. National research shows that Latinx student borrowers are  percent more likely to default on student loans than White students, according to PCCs report.Although Illinois saw an  percent increase of Latinx high school graduates as well as college enrollment double from  to , the rate of earning fouryear degrees did not share the same growth. This is due to low transfer and completion rates. Additionally, in terms of tuition cost, Latinx families pay  percent of their income to attend public universities and  percent for private universities, compared to White families who pay  percent and  percent, the report found. Kyle WestbrookIn general, in order to address these equity issues, institutions need to focus on remedial courses and developmental education to ensure that Illinois is giving students the best possible chance to succeed, according to Westbrook.At the state level, Illinois needs to reinvest in its institutions. Both reports advocated and recommended an equitydriven funding formula for higher education, meaning the institutions who serve the highest percentage of lowincome or underrepresented students should receive a higher appropriation than public institutions that are not serving representative portions of student populations in terms of race and socioeconomic status, said Westbrook.Within the next week, PCC will release the last report titled Priced Out: Rural Students which focuses on the divide between those who can afford to leave their hometown for fouryear degrees from public and private institutions and those that stay in the area to earn twoyear degrees .Higher costs means they incur more debt and higher debt means that these students can less afford to move back to their hometown, said Abrahamson. Theres a lot of national research that says a lot of rural students do want to move back and raise families in the places they are from but with large amounts of student debt, because they stand to make more in cities, its a less tenable proposition which is both inequitable and bad for the state.In order to see results within the states higher education system, the reports should be shared with both institutions and policy makers, said Abrahamson.I hope these reports will be a good launching pad for conversations on these topics, he said. I think we have to have these conversations with the public and that this is about investment, its about the future of our state and equity.Sarah Wood can be reached at .

       "4  Download Wirepoints accompanying handout: Chicagos Financial CrisisToday, we are here to talk about the citys  budget, but Id argue thats the wrong way to look at this crisis.It seems to me that everybody, every year, treats the citys oneyear budget deficits as if thats the real issue. As if thats the real problem that needs to be solved. In fact, everybody breathed a sigh of relief when Mayor Lightfoot didnt resort to a property tax hike to close the gap. That shouldnt have been the big achievement.Thats the problem. By focusing onone year budgets, its like were treating an intensive care patient with aspirin. Chicagos problems are far larger than a oneyear deficit. Its problems are multiyear, multigovernment and structural.When you add them all up, Chicagos problems make it an extreme outlier nationally. Chicago households are burdened with far more debt than any other major city in the country.The citys credit rating sits alone with Detroit at junk. CPS is even worse than Detroit.Chicago is also an outlier among the big cities in its population drop  nobody else has lost people four years in a row.And property values, in real terms, are worth less today than they were in . Chicagos growth drags far below that of other big cities.Focusing on oneyear budgets only perpetuates those problems.Our position at Wirepoints is that Chicagoans are stuck with more retirement debts than they can ever repay. Add up the debt of overlapping governments and put that burden on those households with the means to pay  say those making , or more  and youre looking at a burden of , per household. Thats an impossible amount.That burden will force more Chicagoans to flee, joining the , residents who already left between  and . And the citys downward spiral will continue.Chicago is in a mess because its politicians have failed to attack the citys longterm problems: the cumulative, overlapping debts and the collective bargaining laws that end up inflating those debts year after year.Thats why weve got to stop looking at these problems on a shortterm, piecemeal basis. Because when we do it that way, one government in isolation, it allows lawmakers to get away with things that make no sense.How else do you explain Mayor Lightfoot going to Gov. Pritzker to ask for a state takeover of city pensions, and then right after that, she offers what she calls the most lucrative contract in the CTUs historyIf you are an ordinary Chicagoan, that doesnt make any sense. And it shouldnt. But its the system that we have. It enables the bad behavior by both politicians and the unions.Every year its the same thing. Politicians try to put a patch on something thats fundamentally broken.But if they were to try and do things right, Mayor Lightfoot would change course and put together a workout team  a restructuring group  that determines how to reduce Chicagos debts so that the city can become competitive again in taxation, services, and its economic environment.Shed also use the bully pulpit as mayor of the nations rdbiggest city to demand an amendment to the pension protection clause and a rollback in collective bargaining laws. After the strike, she may consider that.What Ive just said is unlikely, yes, but Id argue entirely necessary. And inevitable. The alternative is collapse. And nobody wants that.
