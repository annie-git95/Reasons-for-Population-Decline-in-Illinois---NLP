# Reasons-for-Population-Decline-in-Illinois---NLP

Illinois is famous for being one of the very few states in the country with negative population growth.  The objective of this project is to:

Identify the key reasons for the declining population by extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text and to provide actionable recommendations on what can be done to reverse this trend.


The data used is a collection of a couple of monthsâ€™ worth of news articles attached in this repo.

The news articles are related to either Chicago and / or Illinois.

## The following steps were implemented: 

Clean-up the noise (eliminate articles irrelevant to the analysis)

Detect major topics (i.e. LSA, LDA and TF-IDF)

Identify top reasons for population decline (negative sentiment)

Use Entity Recognition Techniques to distinguish Organizations and People

Suggest corrective actions

Demonstrate how the city / state can attract new businesses (positive sentiment)

Leverage appropriate NLP techniques to identify organizations and people and apply targeted sentiment
